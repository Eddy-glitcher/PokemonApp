# Project Structure
The system of organization used in this project is described whit the next structure.

1. The **PokedexApp** file is used to contain all the entire aplication, this file acts as a main Module for the aplication.

2. The **components** folder was created to implement the component system, dividing the functionalities of the application into small parts.

## List of components in components file.
1. **pokemon-card** : This component is used to display the stats and basic information of a pokemon and generate a card. The component receives a Pokémon (Object) and displays the corresponding information.

2. **pokemon-filters**: This component contains a list of Pokémon types in a carousel generated by the ngx-owl-carousel-o package. Each button in the list displays the type name and corresponding type image. When any of the generated buttons is pressed, the Pokémon list is updated with the corresponding type.

3. **pokemon-input**: This component is used to search for a Pokémon by name or keywords. It implements a debouncer to display a list of suggestions based on the input text. This functionality is provided through Event Emitters.

4. **pokemon-loader**: This components is displayed when the data is loading. It contains an image and text that describe the loading state.

------------
## Interfaces
The Interfaces used in this project were generated by [quicktype.io](https://quicktype.io/ "quicktype.io").
1. **pokemon-data**: This interface describes the data of each individual Pokémon.

2. **pokemon-type**: This interface describes the data of each Pokémon categorized by type.

3. **pokemon-list**: This interface describes the data type of the list of Pokémon.

4. **pokemon-filters**: This interface describes the data type of the Pokémon filters.

------------
## Pages
The pages are the different views of the project:

1. **home-page**: This component displays the main view of the application and groups various components such as **pokemon-input** to search for Pokémon by name, **pokemon-filters** to search for Pokémon by type and **pokemon-card** to display each Pokémon in the list.

2. **pokemon-view**: This component displays the stats and details of the selected Pokémon. This component use the pokemon-loader to display a loader until the pokemon details are loaded.

------------
## Shared 
The shared file is used to contain components that will be shared across different contexts of the application:

1. **header.component**: This component represents the application header, consisting of a poster image and a background color.

------------
## Pipes
This project uses custom pipes to transform the output data.

1. **defaultpokemon-image.pipe**: This pipe is used to set a default poster image for the Pokémon, when the Pokémon does´nt have it in the API response.

2. **height-weight.pipe**: This pipe is used to format the data for Pokémon height and weight.

------------
## Services
This file contains all the service functionalities to communicate the application whit the API (PokeApi):

1. **poke-api.service**: This service is responsible for retrieving the Pokémon data from the PokeAPI. It implements multiple functions to enable HTTP requests for seamless communication.

------------
## Lazy-loading
This application uses a simple sistem of routes whit lazy-loading:

1. **home**: This route load the **home-page.component**, this is the route by default.

2. **pokemon/:name**: This route loads the **pokemon-view.component**. The route receives a Pokémon name as a parameter to load the stats and basic information of the Pokémon.

3. If the route does´nt exists, the **home** route is loaded by default.

# Lessons and knowledge acquired
Whit this project a learn a lot. I learn how to plan, organize and implement a project or application in Angular:

- To create a project or bring an idea to life, it is necessary to design a list of requirements to understand the scope of the project and all the project rules.

- To start a project, we need to plan, research, organize, and design prototypes using graphic design tools like Figma, for example, for UI/UX design. This method of implementation ensures quality and helps manage development time effectively.

- I embraced concepts such as lazy-loading, components, Event Emitters, Services, and HTTP requests to work with Angular.

- Interfaces helped me work with data and implement it following specific rules to prevent errors.

- I separated the application and its functionality using modules to improve quality, performance, and change tolerance through modular development.

- I understood how to optimize and implement images with the latest format, AVIF, to enhance the application's performance.

- I recognized the importance of implementing a repository system with Git and GitHub.

- The documentation of the multiple technologies used on this project, was essential to implement the best practices and develop software whit the highest quality and performance. This allowed us to provide a meaningful solution tha helps improve the people´s lives.
